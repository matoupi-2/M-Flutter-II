  "description": "Easily the city’s most famous club – and some would say the world’s best – Berghain is not just for world-class techno: it’s a way of life for many of the tireless regulars who call it a ‘church’. It’s open, complete with dark rooms, from Friday midnight until well into Monday morning. The club’s reputation for a difficult and random door policy is not entirely undeserved: doorman Sven (recognisable by his facial tattoos) looms large all night with a seemingly haphazard attitude to who gets in.",
